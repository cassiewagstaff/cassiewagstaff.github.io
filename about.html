            <p>Cassie Wagstaff has been interested in photography for most of her life. She got her first camera when she was 12 years old and her first DSLR when she was 18 years old. Between high school yearbook committee and college photography courses, Cassie has learned a lot.</p>
            <p>Cassie started printing her photographs a year ago. She quickly discovered that clients loved to have their photographs printed for them as well. So between photoshoots and editing, she is also running to the print shop to order and pick up those prints for clients.</p>
            <p>Cassie prints through Quick Ship and Copy in Rexburg, Idaho. Check out her pricing {link}. She can print at multiple sizes, which can also be found on the pricing page. Quick Ship and Copy has been a very reliable printing location. Cassie hopes to one day own her own printer and work on everything herself.</p>
            <p>Most of Cassie's clients are in Rexburg. But she is willing to ship prints to clients outside of Rexburg, with a small shipping fee.</p>
            <p>Cassie is also willing to take portraiture photography for those who specifically contact her. Please <a href="contact.html">contact</a> her for your next session! Photoprints can be included.</p>
